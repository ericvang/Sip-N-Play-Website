# SIP-N-PLAY WEBSITE
By: Eric Vang and Madison Lin
*Submission for the 2024 Codedex Summer Hackathon!*


Summary
---
This project is a 3D Website for a Board Game Cafe. The project features a 3D rotating website, where you can browse various information about the cafe, such as the menu and calendar. As you scroll, your camera follows a turtle around the world and popups of information appear. Our menu uses 3D models of each menu item that you can rotate and scale. 

In our original concept, we wanted our camera to follow a board game piece as it rotates around the board, but with only two members and no blender experience, we used existing 3D models. Thus, we follow a turtle around the world instead.

We utilized various tools: Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Three.js. This was our first time learning and using Three.js! Despite not sleeping to get through it, we had a lot of fun making it! :)

How to Run
---
We have not published this website, but temporarily, you can run a demo of it via **npm run dev** after cd-ing into the project. Then you can load a local demo of it.
